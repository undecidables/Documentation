# Requirements-Documentation
This repo contains the documentation regarding the COSBAS System.
<br>
This includes:
* Functional Requirements
* Non-Functional Requirements
* User Manual

Work alocation is shown in the 21 May document in the planning folder.
The idea is to complete both the functional and architectural requirements asap so we can start coding.
