Meeting:
Put server on departmental server on/behind dmc
get quotes on everything not just cameras…. (All infrastructure!)
Logging - staff members are more important
Calendar - As many as possible :D (Google important and then outlook.) Good idea to keep a helpdesk calendar…
Notifications can be via sms, qrcodes etc (Think technological :D)
Email Prof. Engelbrecht for his github username.
