%I strongly recomend using seperate tex files for each of the following sections and just include them here.

	\section{Introduction}
	In this section of the document we will identify and address a high level overview of the COSBAS (Computer Science Biometric Access System) system. The reason for building this system is because currently it is too difficult for students to gain authorized access to the department when they have a meeting with a lecturer. There is also no means of gathering data on who is entering or leaving the department and there is no easy means of creating or requesting appointments with a specific lecturer.
	
	\section{Vision and Objectives}
	\subsection{Vision}
	The vision of the COSBAS system is to create a biometric access control system that makes use of different biometric devices and the latest mobile technologies to grant access to visitors and staff members.The system will also serve as an appointment system between lecturers, visitors and students.

	\subsection{Objectives}
	The main objectives of the COSBAS system is:
	\begin{itemize}	
 		\item to provide secure biometric access to not only staff members of the department, but visitors as well.
		\item to provide the ability to make appointments by means of a web interface. 
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Terminology/Clarifications}
	\begin{itemize}	
 		\item A \textbf{booking} is when a user, either a guest or a staff member, requests an appointment with a staff member. 
		\item An \textbf{appointment} is when the particular staff member, with whom the booking is made, approves the booking.
	\end{itemize}
