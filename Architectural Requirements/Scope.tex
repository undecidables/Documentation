\subsubsection{Persistence}
Persisting system valuable information will take place in a database environment. In the scope of this project a non-relational and noSQL database will be used. MongoDB was chosen as the best solution for the COSBAS project.

\subsubsection{Communication}
A client-server architecture will be used to communicate. We will use server requests sent from either the web browser or from the rasberry-pi computers.
