COSBAS will integrate with the following channels:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The CS LDAP server in order to retrieve login details of the lecturers.
	\item The postgrad meeting system in order to help with making appointments.
	\item Any online calendars used, such as Google calendar or Outlook, in order to gain access to the lecturers' calendars.
	\item The COSBAS-server to process the data and grant or deny access.
	\item The Spring MVC framework, to help with dependency injection and connecting all the components together.
	\item Our MongoDB database for access to the registered users'  stored biometric data as well as the appointment information of the staff members. 
\end{itemize}
