This project will use the Gradle build system.

Our reasons for choosing Gradle:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gradle is generally seen as incorporating the best aspects of Maven and Ant -  It has Ant’s power and flexibility with Maven’s life-cycle and ease of use. \cite{Farcic2014, Timosin2013}
	\item Gradle can download dependencies from Maven and Ivy repositories including the Maven Central repository so all Maven packages can be used with gradle. \cite{GradleDocChap8}
	\item Gradle's Groovy-based build script is more concise than Maven's XML pom. \cite{Farcic2014}
	\item Gradle 2.5 allows for multiple build-types and simple custom tasks \cite{GradleChap55}. This is useful for our client app that has one version for access requests and one version for registration.
	\item Even though Gradle is considered to have a bigger learning curve than Maven, it is extremely powerful \cite{Timosin2013} and the DSL is simple to understand once you get the basics. \cite{Farcic2014}
	
\end{itemize}
