This project will use the Gradle build system.


Our reasons for choosing the Gradle build system
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gradle is generally seen as incorporating the best aspects of Maven and Ant
	\item Gradle's Groovy-base buildscript is a lot shorter than Maven's XML pom
	\item Gradle 2.5 allows for multiple build-types which will work excellent for our client app that has one version for access requests and one version for registration.
	
\end{itemize}
