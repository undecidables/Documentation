\subsection{MVC Architectural Pattern}
	\subsubsection{Description}
	MVC (Model-view-controller) is a software architectural pattern which devides the software application into three interconnected parts, so as to seperate the internal representation from the way the information is represented to the user.
	\subsubsection{Reason for use}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Client-Server communication}
		\item{Reduced code complexity}
		\item{Efficient code-reuse}
		\item{Decoupled code}
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Adapter Design Pattern}
	\subsubsection{Description}
	The adapter design pattern changes or converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects. The design pattern makes classes that would normally not be able to work together, interact seamlessly.
	
	\subsubsection{Reason for use}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Increased plugability of the system} - Because many different biometric access points as well as non-biometric access points will have to interact with the system. This makes it easy for a new type of access point to be added to the system.
	\end{itemize}
